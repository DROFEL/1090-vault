- An ordered sequence of strings that show complex strings being formed piece by piece, with each new string adding a new part to the formula.
- Strings added must hold the following rules:
	1: you can add any new boolean variable or constant ( vars must be written in () but const don't)
	2: you can negate any existing boolean var or const $(\neg A)$
	3: you can add a connective between any bool var or const $(A \lor B)$

Example:
$p,q,(\neg q),(p \land (\neg q))$
