## Tautology
a [[well_formed_formula|wff]] is a tautology iff it is true in all possible states
this is denoted by $\vDash _{taut} A$ 
imagine $\vDash$ is a $\Rightarrow$, that's honestly it lol
if nothing is on the left side then just imagine nothing being there

To prove a wff is a tautology, you may use a [[truth_tables|truth table]] or a truth table shortcut. Remember to explain your truth table (explain why the truth table proves the wff is a tautology)
If the wff is not a tautology, give an instance/counterexample

## Satisfiable
there is at least one state where the [[state_v|v(A)=t]]  (It can be true)

## Unsatifiable
every [[state_v| state v]] we have $v(A)=f$
