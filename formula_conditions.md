## Tautology
a [[well_formed_formula|wff]] is a tautology iff it is true in all possible states
this is denoted by $\vDash _{taut} A$ 
imagine $\vDash$ is a $\Rightarrow$, that's honestly it lol
if nothing is on the left side then just imagine nothing being there

## Satisfiable
there is at least one state where the [[state_v|v(A)=t]]  (It can be true)

## Unsatifiable
every [[state_v| state v]] we have $v(A)=f$
