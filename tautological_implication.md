- mathmatical truths
- our goal is to develop our logic to prove these truths

- A [[string]] (A) can be [[formula_conditions#Tautology|tautologically]] implied by a [[formula_sets|formula set]] $\Gamma$ iff for every [[state_v]] that [[formula_conditions#Satisfiable|statisfies]] $\Gamma$, the [[state_v|state v]] of A returns true (whenever the whole formula set is true A is true)
- this is denoted by 
  ## $\Gamma$$\vDash _{taut} A$ 
  (if $\Gamma$ returns true  than the part $A$ is true) 

## Hypothesis
- also known as Premises The formulae on the left side of the $\vDash _{taut}$
- the "if" part of the proof
## Conclusion
- The formulae on the Right side of the $\vDash _{taut}$
- the "than" part of the proof
