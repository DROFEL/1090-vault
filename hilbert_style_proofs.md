- Starts with [[tautological_implication#Hypothesis|premises]] and [[logical_axiom|axioms]]
- you continute to apply [[rules_of_inference|rules]] untill you get to the [[tautological_implication#Conclusion|Conclusion]]
- [[hilbert_style_proofs|Hilbert Proofs]] are linear and every new step comes from [[tautological_implication#Hypothesis|premises]], [[logical_axiom|axioms]], or are justified by previously written steps
- 
To prove $\Gamma \vdash A$:

| axiom #                                                                        | axiom                                                | annotiation (explain) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| you must start with a formula from [[rules_of_inference]] or [[logical_axiom]] | because of the first rule of [[theorem_calculation]] |                       |
| once you reach [[formula]] $A$ then you're done the proof                                                                               |                                                      |                       |
|                                                                                |                                                      |                       |
