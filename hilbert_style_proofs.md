- Starts with [[tautological_implication#Hypothesis|premises]] and [[logical_axiom|axioms]]
- you continute to apply [[rules_of_inference|rules]] untill you get to the [[tautological_implication#Conclusion|Conclusion]]
- [[hilbert_style_proofs|Hilbert Proofs]] are linear and every new step comes from [[tautological_implication#Hypothesis|Hypothesis]], [[logical_axiom|axioms]], or are justified by previously written steps

To prove $\Gamma \vdash A$: ([[tautological_implication#Hypothesis|Hypothesis]] $\Gamma$ proves $A$ ) ($\Gamma$ being a set of formulae [[formula_sets|set of formulae]])
