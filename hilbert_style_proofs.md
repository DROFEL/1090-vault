To prove $\Gamma \vdash A$:

| axiom #                                                                        | axiom                                                | annotiation (explain) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| you must start with a formula from [[rules_of_inference]] or [[logical_axiom]] | because of the first rule of [[theorem_calculation]] |                       |
| once you reach [[formula]] $A$ then you're done the proof                                                                               |                                                      |                       |
|                                                                                |                                                      |                       |
