#TODO 
- also known as post's theorem
- our [[bolean_logic]] is complete and everthing that is true can be represented and proved in [[bolean_logic]]
- we can use completeness along with [[truth_tables]] to show provable equivalnces



$B,A \rightarrow B \vdash A$
contradiction
$B,\neg A, A\rightarrow B \vdash \bot$
