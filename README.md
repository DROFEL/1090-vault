# 1090-vault
A glossary/obsidian vault to decode this jargon filled spaghetti course (MATH 1090 F22)
Created by Jayden Brooks :)
Based on the course as taught by Prof May so YMMV

Making it public so other people can fix the spelling mistakes (also maybe improve/contribute to it if they'd like)

use obsidian (https://obsidian.md/) to read/contribute 

Helpful for writing Latex (use $ text $ to add latex symbols to a page  )
