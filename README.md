# 1090-vault
A glossary/obsidian vault to decode this jargon filled spaghetti course (MATH 1090 F22)

Making it public so other people can fix the spelling mistakes (also maybe improve/contribute to it if they'd like)

use obsidian (https://obsidian.md/) to read/contribute 

Helpful for writing Latex
