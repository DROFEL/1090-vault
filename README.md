# 1090-vault
- A glossary/obsidian vault for MATH 1090 F22
- Created by Jayden Brooks :)
- Based on the course as taught by Prof May so YMMV
- Making it public so other people can fix the spelling mistakes (also maybe improve/contribute to it if they'd like)

Helpful for writing Latex (use $ text $ to add latex symbols to a page  )

Also make sure to enable the Community Plugins for Auto Pushing and Pulling to a repository

### How to view and contribute
- use obsidian (https://obsidian.md/) 
- look at unlinked pages or pages with the # TODO tag on them to figure out which ones need to get worked on
- also feel free to improve any definitons based on ones you think are more intuitive/understandable

### What the 1090 students are saying about it:
"Very... concise." - Arianne 
"It's better than nothing" - Sana
